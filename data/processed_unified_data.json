What is the difference between belief and knowledge? Why are we prone to thinking and reasoning poorly? Our courses explore questions like these through the study of ethics, law, logical thinking, metaphysics, epistemology, political philosophy, and various controversies associated with race, gender, religion, politics, economics, science, technology, and artificial intelligence. We seek truth by asking questions, answering the questions, and questioning the answers, always with respect for the views and arguments of others.
