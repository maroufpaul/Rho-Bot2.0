Through integrative teaching and research, students develop and apply the skills needed to analyze the dynamic processes and structures of urban life and health as well as the ways that cities contribute to global change. Students engage fully with Memphis and the diversity of the mid-south region, as they learn to situate them within a global context. The major combines coursework with urban field experiences, including internships, fellowships, and research with community partners.",
