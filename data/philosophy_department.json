  "departmentDescription": "Courses in the Department of Philosophy explore life’s most interesting and fundamental questions: What does it mean to be human? To be a person? Who am I and how should I live? Does life have meaning? Does God exist? What does it mean to be free? What are our duties to others? What principles should govern our social and political life? What is the difference between belief and knowledge? Why are we prone to thinking and reasoning poorly? Our courses explore questions like these through the study of ethics, law, logical thinking, metaphysics, epistemology, political philosophy, and various controversies associated with race, gender, religion, politics, economics, science, technology, and artificial intelligence. We seek truth by asking questions, answering the questions, and questioning the answers, always with respect for the views and arguments of others. Philosophy courses will sharpen a student’s analytical reading, thinking, and writing, all of which are indispensable skills prized by graduate schools, law schools, and employers.",
