    "departmentDescription": "The mission of the Media Studies Program is to enable students to become astute scholars, producers, and consumers of visual media. From film to TV to digital and social media, our worlds are saturated with and mediated by visual communications. Media Studies courses equip students with: 1) critical tools for critiquing visual media, 2) creative capabilities for producing digital art, and 3) practical communication skills for participating in globalized media networks. Interdisciplinary by design, the Media Studies Program is supported by faculty from three divisions—Fine Arts, Humanities, and Social Sciences—in order to cover media theories and practices in the broadest sense and stress digital literacy and fluency across multiple media. Its forward-thinking approach emphasizes interdisciplinarity, a globalized curriculum, and career readiness.",
